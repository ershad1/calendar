# Calendar

This is the code 'calendar' application that is built through the course of book [Getting MEAN](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node).

And combined with various internet and github source code. I tried to structure all the code by the suggestion of Getting Mean book.

The app can be make robust by adding many feature in their respective folders.

# app_api

This folder is for Rest services

# app_client

This folder is for angularjs app. this folder can be copied and used as a front end for other backend tecnologies like
spring boot.

# public

This folder is for javascript and stylesheet support.


# Issues

Sockit.io and model update is not currently working. 
Now you have to refresh manually to see the change.

i will try to fix it later.
